This is a project Wilmer and Diana are undertaking to better understand audio processing. Primarily in python, this project aims to create a fun game, where the input audio is modified in real time to change the tempo. The goal of the player is to keep up with the tempo by clapping at the correct times. The only hardware necessary should be your computer. This is being tested and developed on mac OS.
